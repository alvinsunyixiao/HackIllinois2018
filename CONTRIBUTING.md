# Contributing to VisionSonic

### Welcome, contributors to VisionSonic!!!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VisionSonic! Although we are still at a starting stage, every member of the team is very confident and passionate. This document will outline the basics of where to start if you wish to contribute to the project. There are many ways to help us out and and we appreciate all of them. We look forward to your contribution!

### Development environment details

* Please see README.md

### Issues and future features

We still have several issues to be done to make Visionsonic better:

* Our program is built on a camera with small angle, it still need to fit for better devices
* The project still need more practices on test people and further modifications on alert system based on the outcome
* Detection model will be updated later
* With the above further updates, the voice feedback will need expansion


### Report a bug, request a feature, or any other suggestion

The quickest way to communicate with the VisionSonic team is by email. Currently, you can only get an invite by sending an email request to `alvinsunyixiao@gmail.com`, which might take a little while, since it's not automated. We're working on an better way to do this, but this is the best way for now.



Thanks!
